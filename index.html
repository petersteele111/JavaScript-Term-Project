<!-- For the design I opted for a grid system that lays out three equal width boxes on the main page with a simple header at the top. Then I have a tab system for a description of each game -->
<!-- For the color scheme, I went with my favorite colors of Red, Black, and White. I love the combination of these colors and think it looks nice.  -->
<!-- The audience for these games is general. There are games for the older generation like chess and blackjack, a game for younger kids and teens like SnappyBird, and a general purpose young adult game with BreakOut -->
<!-- The interface is fully mobile compliant with a mobile first approach. The site should work and look great on a variety of devices. -->

                    <p>SnappyBird is a fun, casual game that allows you to use the keyboard to attempt to navigate the bird through the pipes without touching them. If you touch a pipe or collide with the ground, you lose! While the game seems simple in concept, it get's trickier the farther you go. The game will speed up as well, making your timing all the more important. Do you have what it takes to beat the high score and be the reigning champ? Try your luck with SnappyBird and see just how good you are!</p>

                <div id="gameTab2" class="tabContent">
                    <p>The classic game of BreakOut! A game that has captivated audiences for decades. The premise is simple, yet the execution can be difficult. A ball is randomly thrown out and you have a paddle at the bottom of the screen that must smack the ball back towards the bricks. Break all of the bricks without running out of lives and you win! Miss the ball with the paddle though, and you will lose a life. Take on the classic today by clicking the play button!</p>

                <div id="gameTab3" class="tabContent">
                    <p>Snake is a classic game that seems simple in theory but very difficult in practice. While the initial stages are easy, the longer your snake gets as you eat, the more difficult it becomes to avoid hitting yourself! To play, all you need to do is use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the snake around and eat the food that appears on the screen. Be careful though, if you hit the edges, or yourself, its game over!</p>

<h1>SnappyBird</h1>
<p>SnappyBird is a fun, casual game that allows you to use the keyboard to attempt to navigate the bird through the pipes without touching them. If you touch a pipe or collide with the ground, you lose! While the game seems simple in concept, it get's trickier the farther you go. The game will speed up as well, making your timing all the more important. Do you have what it takes to beat the high score and be the reigning champ? Try your luck with SnappyBird and see just how good you are!</p>

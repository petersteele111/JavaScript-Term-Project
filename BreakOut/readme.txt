Breakout is a classic game fun for all ages! Simply move the paddle board around the screen to bounce the ball back and forth between the bricks. The goal of the game is to break all of the bricks before losing all of you lifes! If you break them all you win, if not you lose.
No current issues or problems with the game. It is fully functional
Future versions, I would like to include reliable sound for breaking or bouncing off the bricks. I would also like to add in the ability to play different levels.
